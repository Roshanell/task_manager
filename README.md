## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstraps

This project was completed in an effort to create  a system that keeps me on track when coding. Often times I noticed that itme flies when I code. I use the Pomodoro feature to help me stay on task.  This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.


## Lessons Learned:

Bootstrap can be an easier way to help develop your site.
## Optimizations

This was my first time using Bootstrap and I know that there are a plethora of ways to effectively intergrate it into my code. I could have added a database that stored previous tasks so that users can see what tasks were completed.
